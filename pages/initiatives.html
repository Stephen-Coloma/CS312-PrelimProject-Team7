                            Recent studies emphasize the importance of integrating resilience strategies, such as
                            green infrastructure and disaster preparedness, into urban planning. These strategies
                            are crucial for cities to withstand the increasing risks associated with climate change
                            (Rozhenkova et al., 2019).

                            Research highlights that inclusive housing policies, such as mixed-income developments,
                            are effective in reducing urban inequality and fostering social cohesion in cities

                            Studies have found that cities adopting sustainable transportation solutions, including

                            Research into urban green infrastructure (UGI) shows its vital role in supporting
