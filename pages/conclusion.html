                    <p id="discussion">Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) is crucial because it focuses on transforming our cities and 
                        communities into inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable environments. As more people move to urban 
                        areas, the pressure on housing, infrastructure, and resources increases significantly. This goal
                        emphasizes the need for well-planned urban development that ensures everyone has access to basic services 
                        like clean water, affordable housing, and reliable public transport. Moreover, it stresses the importance 
                        of reducing environmental impacts and protecting cultural heritage. By prioritizing sustainable 
                        urban development, we can improve the quality of life for millions of people and create cities that 
                        are better equipped to handle future challenges.</p>
