                "Sa Layag ng Bangkang Paurong" is a 2019 documentary film by the Alaminos City National High Schoolâ€™s Layag Productions that explores how urbanization affects local communities
                 in the Philippines. The film tells the story of Milboy, a young boatman from Alaminos City, which is home to the famous Hundred Islands. As the city grows and
                  tourism increases, Milboyâ€™s experience highlights the struggle between maintaining traditional ways of life and adapting to the pressures of a rapidly changing 
                  environment. 
            </p>
            <P class="feature-paragraph">
                Urbanization brings new opportunities, but it also presents significant challenges. For young people like Milboy, the need to work and support their families
                 often comes at the expense of education and future prospects. The documentary sheds light on these issues, showing how economic growth can lead to early employment, 
                 disrupted schooling, and the gradual loss of cultural heritage. This film adds a personal perspective to the broader discussion 
                 about the current state of cities in the Philippines. As urban areas expand, they often do so at the cost of social stability and cultural preservation. Milboyâ€™s 
                 story is a reminder of the human impact behind these trends.
