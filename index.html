                    In 1990, the global population was just almost 2 billion people. Last year, 2023, the global population peaked at 8.1 billion 
                    and it is expected to continue rising for years to come. Further, the rate of people being born is greater than the rate of
                    people dying each year. Last year, 2023, there were 132.11 million births recorded while 61.65 million deaths were recorded.
                    With these patterns, it's undeniable that our population is growing rapidly which imposes problems on many factors.
