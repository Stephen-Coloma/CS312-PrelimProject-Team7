                    In 1990, the global population was just almost 2 billion people. Last year, 2023, the global population peaked at 8.1 billion 
                    and it is expected to continue rising for years to come. Further, the rate of people being born is greater than the rate of
                    people dying each year. Last year, 2023, there were 132.11 million births recorded while 61.65 million deaths were recorded.
                    With these patterns, it's undeniable that our population is growing rapidly which imposes problems on many factors.

                    It prioritizes assuring access to affordable housing, improving public transportation, safeguarding cultural and natural heritage and  increasing access to green public spaces. 
                    It highlights the need to create urban environments that promote economic, social, and environmental well-being for all citizens, especially the most vulnerable regions.</p>

                    Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by focusing on key areas such as housing, 
                    transport, urbanization, heritage protection, disaster risk reduction, environmental impact, public 
                    spaces, development planning, policy implementation, and support for the least developed countries. 
                    This goal is essential as more people move to urban areas, increasing the need for sustainable 
                    development that ensures a high quality of life for everyone. By addressing these areas, 
                    Goal 11 seeks to create cities that are not only livable and efficient but also environmentally 
                    friendly and socially inclusive, ensuring that no one is left behind in the progress towards a better 
                    future.
